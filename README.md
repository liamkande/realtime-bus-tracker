# realtime-bus-tracker

This tracker will show a standard, red marker for each bus on the Google Map on the MBTA Bus Route #1.


## Make It Run
- The html page will need to be served by a simple HTTP server to work
- You will need to obtain and insert your own Google Maps API key in the script tag loading the Google Maps API in the html file

## Future enhancements
- Replace tag icons with vehicle icons
- Add additional metadata to the icons, perhaps bus id, latlong coords
- More error handling
